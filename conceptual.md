### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What are some ways of managing asynchronous code in JavaScript?
  Callbacks: Traditional way, but can lead to callback hell.
  Promises: Allow better handling of asynchronous operations and chaining.
  Async/Await: Syntactic sugar on top of Promises, making asynchronous code more readable.

- What is a Promise?
  A Promise in JavaScript represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

- What are the differences between an async function and a regular function?
  An async function always returns a Promise.
  await can only be used inside async functions, and it pauses the execution until the Promise is settled.
  Regular functions run synchronously, while async functions can be asynchronous.

- What is the difference between Node.js and Express.js?
  Node.js is a runtime that allows JavaScript to run server-side.
  Express.js is a web application framework built on top of Node.js, simplifying server-side development by providing features like routing and middleware.

- What is the error-first callback pattern?
  It is a convention in Node.js where callback functions take an error object as their first parameter. If there is no error, the first parameter is null or undefined.

- What is middleware?
  Middleware functions in Express.js have access to the request, response, and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. They can modify the request or response, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware in the stack.

- What does the `next` function do?
  In Express.js middleware, next is a function that, when invoked, passes control to the next middleware in the stack.

- What are some issues with the following code? (consider all aspects: performance, structure, naming, etc)
  Performance: The requests are executed sequentially, causing unnecessary delays. They could be parallelized.
  Structure: The function could be more modular, with a more generic approach to fetching user data.
  Naming: Inconsistent naming (e.g., matt and mmmaaatttttt), which can lead to confusion.

```js
async function getUsers() {
  try {
    const [elie, joel, matt] = await Promise.all([
      $.getJSON("https://api.github.com/users/elie"),
      $.getJSON("https://api.github.com/users/joelburton"),
      $.getJSON("https://api.github.com/users/mmmaaatttttt"),
    ]);

    return [elie, joel, matt];
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching user data:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```
